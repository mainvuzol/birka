# Durable Business Rules

- The application must simplify the existing notebook-based workflow rather than impose technical IDs on store staff.
- Parent/primary and child/related stores share one business system but maintain store-specific inventory.
- Transfers between stores are explicit transfer movements, not sales.
- Business category and garment type are separate concepts.
- Raw catalog input is immutable evidence.
- Catalog identity uses CanonicalConcept -> ProductFamily -> ProductVariant; same shop name across sources is not automatically the same family.
- Source-like labels are stored separately and may remain semantically UNKNOWN until confirmed.
- Slash-separated values may represent multiple variants; slash is not automatically alias syntax.
- Size inventory must support both alpha and numeric size systems.
- Unknown terms remain unclassified until evidence supports classification.
- Owner confirmation (2026-09-14): staff very rarely record a product using its known item code instead of a descriptive name. Preserve such codes as optional identifiers when supported by evidence; do not require codes for everyday entry, infer their issuer or uniqueness, treat every bare number as a code, or merge products solely because their codes match.
- Legacy PDFs/availability sheets represent inventory snapshots, not transaction history.
- Adaptive matching requires explicit ambiguity handling and human confirmation when evidence is insufficient.
- User corrections improve alias/retrieval evidence; no online fine-tuning after each correction.
