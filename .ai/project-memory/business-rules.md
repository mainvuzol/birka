# Durable Business Rules

- The application must simplify the existing notebook-based workflow rather than impose technical IDs on store staff.
- Owner clarification (2026-09-15): the primary and child stores both sell from the primary store’s shared warehouse; the child store also has a separate warehouse. Selling store and stock location are distinct concepts. This supersedes the earlier assumption that each store sells only its own store-specific inventory.
- Transfers between stores are explicit transfer movements, not sales.
- Business category and garment type are separate concepts.
- Raw catalog input is immutable evidence.
- Catalog identity uses CanonicalConcept -> ProductFamily -> ProductVariant; same shop name across sources is not automatically the same family.
- Source-like labels are stored separately and may remain semantically UNKNOWN until confirmed.
- Slash-separated values may represent multiple variants; slash is not automatically alias syntax.
- Size inventory must support both alpha and numeric size systems.
- Unknown terms remain unclassified until evidence supports classification.
- Owner confirmation (2026-09-14): staff very rarely record a product using its known item code instead of a descriptive name. Preserve such codes as optional identifiers when supported by evidence; do not require codes for everyday entry, infer their issuer or uniqueness, treat every bare number as a code, or merge products solely because their codes match.
- Legacy PDFs/availability sheets represent inventory snapshots, not transaction history.
- Adaptive matching requires explicit ambiguity handling and human confirmation when evidence is insufficient.
- User corrections improve alias/retrieval evidence; no online fine-tuning after each correction.

## Owner decisions — 2026-09-15

Confirmed requirements; documentation only, not claims of implemented behavior. Detailed scope and unresolved semantics: [warehouse, store status and payment decisions](owner-decisions-2026-09-15.md).

- One primary warehouse supplies both stores; a separate child warehouse also exists. Keep sales attribution separate from the physical stock location; never duplicate the shared quantity under both stores.
- Add explicit store states: temporarily blocked by an administrator and ceased trading/archived. These are not the daily end of a shift. Exact allowed operations and responsible roles require a permission matrix before implementation.
- Returned units are marked intact or damaged. One return may contain both conditions from the same sale line; their aggregate quantity is capped by the remaining returnable quantity. Damaged is a condition, not an automatic write-off or permission to sell it again.
- Owner clarification (2026-09-15): an arbitrary sale amount is the agreed final selling price after negotiation, either below or above the suggested price (for example, +200 UAH). It is not a partial payment and does not itself create debt. Price agreement and payment timing are separate: sales may be paid in full or on installments. Installments concern sales, not paying customer refunds in installments. Freeze the agreed price in the sale; do not rewrite the catalog suggested price.
- Record separately when the store itself acquires goods on installments. Keep the store’s purchase obligations distinct from customer payments and the selling price.
- No automatic return cutoff based on sale age. Existing authorization, original-sale linkage and cumulative quantity limits still apply.
